# {{ page.title }}

The testz suite runner takes a list of suites to a `Future[Unit]`,
printing test failures and successes to standard out.

The suites are passed as `() => Suite` in order to avoid keeping
test data in memory.

```scala
object Runner {
  def apply(suites: List[() => Suite])(implicit ec: ExecutionContext): Future[Unit]
}
```

The test suite type expected by the runner is:

```scala
trait Suite {
  def run(ec: ExecutionContext): Future[List[String]]
}
```

Any value of type `Suite` can be run by the runner.

## Internals

The runner avoids interleaving test output because `Suite`
doesn't print to standard out itself; that's the runner's job.
It prints output given by the `Suite`.

As well, `() => Suite`s are run fully sequentially, and if a
`Suite` runs synchronously, the passed `ExecutionContext` is not
used.

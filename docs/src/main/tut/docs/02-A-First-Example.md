So, letâ€™s start with a simple version of a pure test suite, using the
most basic suite type provided. We'll be using `testz-core`,
`testz-runner`, and `testz-stdlib`.

It's provided in `testz.stdlib.PureSuite`.

```tut:silent
import testz.{PureHarness, PureSuite, assert}
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.global

final class MathTests extends PureSuite {
  def tests[T[_]](harness: PureHarness[T]): T[Unit] = {
    import harness._
    section("math must")(
      test("say 1 + 1 == 2") { _ =>
        assert(1 + 1 == 2)
      }
    )
  }
}
```

To run this type of test suite using the default testz runner,
just call `.run` with an `ExecutionContext`.

The global one is usually fine.

All suites are run synchronously if possible, but will use the
`ExecutionContext` if a suite uses asynchrony.

```tut:book
new MathTests().run(global)
```

I went through a lot there; let's dissect that.

```tut:silent
import testz.{PureSuite, Harness, assert}
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.global
```

Here I import `PureHarness[T[_]]`, the type of test harnesses in a
`PureSuite` Conventionally, test suites are written to extend a
test suite class with an abstract method that takes some type of
harness as a parameter.

I also import `assert` from `testz`; assertions are just values in
testz. `assert` returns either `Success()` if its argument is `True`,
or `Failure.noMessage` otherwise (a failure, with no message).

`PureSuite` is the test suite class I'm using. The type of test
harness it uses is a `PureHarness[T]` for any `T[_]`, and it
returns a `T[Unit]` at the end. The idea behind this is for
the test code to be unaware of what the type `T[A]` will be,
so the only way it can return a `T[Unit]` is to use the test
harness. This means that test registration as an effect is not
exposed in the API - you just can't do it. If you need it, you
can always define your own suite type, but keeping `PureHarness`
limited in this way leads to easier reasoning and makes it easier
not to make mistakes.


```scala
final class MathTests extends PureSuite {
```

We're making a test suite class called `MathTests` extending the suite
type `PureSuite`; `MathTests` is what will show up in the output while
running the suite. This is pretty normal for a Scala test framework,
but note that this is a class and not an object. testz encourages you
not to use singleton objects as test suites. Using objects will prevent
fields of the test suites from being reachable for garbage collection
while tests run. Instead, use a class to keep your working set small
during the run.

```scala
def tests[T[_]](harness: PureHarness[T]): T[Unit] = {
  import harness._
```

Here we define a method from `PureSuite` which we will use to define
our tests. Note that the type of the `test` method *entirely depends*
on the suite type. Any suite type could have give it any signature.
You can write your own suite type and give it any signature you want;
you don't even need to use testz's `Test` test harness types.

We also import all of the methods from `harness`; we'll use `section` and
`test`.

```scala
section("math must")(
```

Declaring a test section. Takes varargs parameters, of type `T`.
Returns a `T`. The only way other than `section` to get a `T`
(when it's abstract) is `test`.

```scala
test("say 1 + 1 == 2") { () =>
```

And here's a test definition, using `test.apply`.
The first parameter is the name of the test. The parameter in the
second (curried) parameter list is a function `() => TestResult`.

```scala
assert(1 + 1 === 2)
```

Here's the only assertion we've got.
It'll give you a `TestResult` which is a `Failure` if the two
arguments aren't equal using `===`, and otherwise a `Success`.

And we're done.
